        "explanation": "Logarithmic functions are the inverse of exponential functions. They grow very slowly as x increases.",
        "examples": ["log(x)", "log(x, 10)", "ln(x)"],
        "properties": "Logarithms convert multiplication to addition: log(a*b) = log(a) + log(b). They are used to model phenomena that grow quickly at first, then slow down."

    "integral": "The integral represents the accumulation of quantities. Geometrically, the definite integral is the signed area between the function and the x-axis over a given interval.",
    "limit": "A limit describes the value a function approaches as the input approaches a particular value. Limits are fundamental to calculus concepts of continuity, derivatives, and integrals.",
    "continuity": "A function is continuous at a point if there is no abrupt change (jump) at that point. Formally, a function is continuous at a point if the limit equals the function value at that point.",
    "extrema": "Extrema are the maximum and minimum values of a function. They can be found by determining where the derivative equals zero (critical points) and analyzing the second derivative.",
    "inflection": "An inflection point is where the curvature of a function changes sign. It occurs when the second derivative equals zero and changes sign around that point.",
    "series": "A series is the sum of the terms of a sequence. Power series represent functions as infinite sums of powers of the variable, useful for approximating functions."
